# MR3001B Design and Development of Robots II

  ## Introduction
* This course, created by Manchester Robotics Ltd. (MCR2), aims to equip students with the required skills to understand manipulator dynamics and control to solve challenges in cyber-physical systems.

* This course is divided into five sections, carefully designed for the user to learn about the different aspects of manipulators, from trajectory tracking and dynamic modelling to control and simulation of a real robot.

  * The first part of this course introduces the basic concepts and general knowledge of dynamical systems.
  * The second part of the course is dedicated to trajectory design and analysis. 
  * The third section is dedicated to the dynamic modelling and simulation of manipulators.
  * The fourth section focuses on basic joint control for manipulators.
  * Finally, the last section is dedicated to the advanced control of manipulators.

* This course will be based on challenges to make the student aware of the problems faced while implementing advanced intelligent algorithms in robotics.
